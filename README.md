# twitchbot_TTS
xanatax open-source twitch-bot perl code ... Mac &amp; Linux text-to-speech bots!

2017 jan 16th ... 1st post!    Mac code is here!
 -- my 1st open-source twitch-bot code ... wish me luck   ;)
 -- I *have* a linux version of this... it works great!
      ... I'll try to clean it up and post soon.
      [ 'espeak' works for TTS!   will setup 'festival' next.  ]

... technically ... 1st mistake:  found, not fixed.
line 487 can be deleted entirely.
hard-coded myself & others to 'authorized' status 
        because I didn't add any code to check mod-status.   :P
        fine, I'll add mod-check next then...
